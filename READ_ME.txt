This is for the "Do it Wrong!" project for MAAD 26210 at the University of Chicago.

HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:
What is pushed to the git page contains sample images and sample emojis to where you can just run "converter.py" and an ouput will appear in "output_pngs". This default output should match what's in "presentation_outputs_just_hearts". To load your own images, put the PNGS in the "input_pngs" folder tilted "input0.png" to "inputX.png" where X is the total number of inputs you have (indexing at zero). To change the emojis, open "emojis.csv" and in each cell/item put in the UTF-8 code for the emoji you wish have. The first emoji should be the emoji you want to represent the darkest parts of your image and the last emoji should represent the lightest parts of your image. The only restraint on the emojis used is that there must be atleast 1, they msut be in the form "U+ABCDE", and all UTF-8 encoded.
